I was excited to collaborate with her on 30 fun and joyful sticker icons she was able to sell in a variety of&nbsp;colorways to her clientele."

I tried to keep the creativity flowing by exploring unconventional poses and different visual elements to help the designs stand on their own.",

Once I worked out the one-color version, I would sketch the next icon in the set. This helped me stay creative while I worked and allowed me to see the whole set before I moved on to the vectorization process. It also allotted me extra time to tweak the designs and check consistency across the group, making the final product more cohesive."
