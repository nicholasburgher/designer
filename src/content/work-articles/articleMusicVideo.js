But, in order to make the animation sync better with the beats of the music, I decided to make it into an 8-frame loop. This gave me the opportunity to improve the water ripple effects in the secondpass."

But it brought to light one thing that bothers me about the music scene I'm into. Most electronic dance music performers put on big expensive lightshows that are mostly incoherent. These shows certainly have that \"coolness factor,\" but they rarely go well with the actual music. It's almost like someone else other than the artist determined the lights and has no idea what was going to happen during the&nbsp;show."

This sort of approach takes into consideration the whole user experience rather than piecemealing together resources that don't really jive. Yes, this takes a lot more work than outsourcing your lights and visuals to a third party, but I believe the value is there. People will come to appreciate the standard of work and the attention to&nbsp;detail!"

I also learned that you can do anything if you put your mind to it and work hard. I learned the importance of planning and storyboarding. I believe that if I were to do another video like this, I would spend even more time in the prep phase. There were 2 animations I completed that never made it into the final cut. I also spent time developing an animation tool I ended up abandoning in favor of doing each frame by hand; the results were better in the long run! Also, don't put the word \"Test\" in the title of something; people won't click it on Youtube."
