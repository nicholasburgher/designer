This fact alone set a fire under me and the other developer to take immediate action in executing on the project. Probably, within hours of getting a green light on initial design concepts, we had a Github repository set up for us to begin our work. We were able to do this because we were given full autonomy to make decisions and execute. In addition, I had periodically picked the brain of the developer to understand his plan for building out the design I was pitching. We had predetermined that it might be possible for me to assist with the buildout since he would likely try building with React.js, a popular front-end framework I was also familiar with using. Also, we could start quickly because I had designed our UI with components in mind."

      "content": "I <strong><u>can not emphasize enough</u></strong> how important it was for the success of this project that we maintained an open and mutually beneficial line of communication. We would tackle coding challenges together, frequently debrief on what we are working on or had recently completed. We would talk about what we might be able to do next after a certain task is complete. We would celebrate successes together! We would consider what was still open and see what would be most valuable to do next; what would help the other person proceed. And we did all of this without a project management system in place. Nothing was assigned but by word of mouth, and everything was immediately tested. We would talk about possible solutions and then take action to make it happen. We would also try and merge code to our main branch every day at some&nbsp;point."

      "component": "Body",
      "content": "For slightly less than 2 weeks, this developer and I were able to accomplish the entire buildout of every page from the design, and have it live by the deadline. I believe cultivating the cooperative, mutually-beneficial environment was critical to helping us reach our goal, for several reasons: accountability, clarity, excitement, focused intensity. These were all present because cooperation and trust was present, along with mutual respect. A benefit of working so closely and intently with another individual is it allows you to understand, and RESPECT their strengths, and weaknesses, so as to play to those in accomplishing the goal. For example, we learned I was way better at CSS than him, so we felt comfortable letting him set infrastructure and having me come in later to style according to spec. I could rely on him to make sure the codebase went live on the servers and to assist with the buildout complex React components. We were ok with our differences and talked openly about them. We were&nbsp;equals."
